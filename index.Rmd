Do women govern better than men? Can corrupt politicians influence local media to get re-elected? How do authoritarian regimes survive during economic crises?

This is an applied course in how to *explain* the outcomes – public policies, democracy, peace, governance, corruption, inequality – we study in political science. It provides students with the skills, tools and confidence to implement a wide range of analyses commonly used in leading political science studies. 

This course is the third course in a three course sequence, following Quantitative Methods I (Introductory Statistics) and Quantitative Methods II (Multivariate Regression).
